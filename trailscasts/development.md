This file contains notes on how to develop a theme for VS Code

## Syntax color vs UI color

There are two things that can be colors in VS Code:

1. The UI of the workbench
2. The syntax of the programming language

## Workbench UI color reference

The below page contains a reference to all the colorizable items on the workbench:

## Tips

* `cd` into the folder of the theme, use `code .` to open the theme project and press `F5` in Code to launch the theme in debug mode in Code.
* To examine TextMate scopes, invoke the `Inspect TM Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes
