# Tasks

The following is the functionality that I need to add to VS Code to bring it to parity with IntelliJ

- [X] Key combination to open a new line below the line that I'm in the middle of. In IntelliJ that is possible by pressing enter while holding down shift while in the middle of a line
- [ ] Change default split to horizontal
- [X] Split editor with CMD+SHIFT+S
- [X] Move line shortcut. On IntelliJ that's OPTION+SHIFT+Arrow keys
- [X] Delete line shortcut. On IntelliJ that's CMD+D
- [X] Duplicate line shortcut. On IntelliJ that's CMD+SHIFT+D
- [X] Split editor shortcut. On IntelliJ that's CMD+SHIFT+S
- [X] Change default tab size to 4
- [X] Open recent project. On IntelliJ that's CMD+SHIFT+P. I made it CTRL+P in Code
- [X] Open file. On IntelliJ that's CMD+SHIFT+O. I made it CTRL+O in Code
- [ ] Search jump feature, like Ace Jump on IntelliJ
- [ ] Remove open editors tree from Explorer
- [ ] Get Emmet to work
