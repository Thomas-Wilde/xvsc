# xvsc

xvsc contains my personal configurations, theme, and the extensions I've developed for VS Code.

xvsc stands for "extras for vsc".

## Content

### [Trailscasts](./trailscasts)

A Dark UI theme inspired by Railscasts.

### [Find Word At Cursor](./findWordAtCursor)

Use keyboard shortcuts to jump through occurrences of the word or selection under cursor.

### [Simple Autocomplete](./simpleAutocomplete)

Fewer keystrokes, no-nonsense autocomplete that cycles through matches based on fuzzy word search performed on the open document(s). This is like IntelliJ's Cyclic Expand Word or NetBeans Hippie Completion.

### [Find-Jump](./findJump) (planned)

Like Ace Jump but with a flow such as:

Keyboard shortcut ➡ Type a few letters to find matches ➡ Jump

### [Smarter Selection](./smarterSelection) (planned)

Like VS Code built-in smart selection feature, but with better abstract syntax trees.

### [Configs](./configs), [xvscMisc](./xvscMisc), and [xvscSnippets](./xvscSnippets)

I also put my `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, and code snippets in this repo. I also have this extension where I put bits and pieces of functionality.
