# xvsc

xvsc contains my personal configurations, theme, and the extensions I've developed for VS Code.

xvsc stands for "extras for vsc".

## Content

### Trailscasts

A Dark UI theme inspired by Railscasts.

### Find Word At Cursor

Use keyboard shortcuts to jump through occurrences of the word or selection under cursor.

### configs

Contains my `keybindings.json` and `settings.json`.

### Simple Autocomplete (under development)

Autocomplete functionality based on all words that appear on the document.

### xvscMisc

An extension with some quick enhancements I've added to VS Code.

### xvscSnippets

An extension that contains my personal VS Code snippets. (Using an extension for snippets allows for more flexibility than using the snippets folder)

### Find-Jump (planned)

Ace Jump but with keyboard search

### Smarter Selection (planned)

Like VS Code built-in smart selection feature, but with better abstract syntax trees.
